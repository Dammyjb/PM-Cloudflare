  commands but half the flags mentioned don't exist in the current version. I followed the official guide step-by-step and it just doesn't work.\n\nThis is
  really frustrating. We chose Cloudflare Tunnel specifically because of the promised simplicity, but I've spent more time debugging docs than actually
  building. Our team is starting to question whether we should just go back to a traditional VPN setup.\n\nCan someone please update the docs or at least
  add a version disclaimer?",

        "comment": "**Environment:** Ubuntu 22.04, cloudflared 2024.1.5, running as systemd service\n\n**Describe the bug:**\nWhen the host system
  experiences memory pressure (OOM killer activated for other processes), cloudflared loses its connection to the edge but does not attempt to reconnect.
  The process remains running with no errors in logs. The tunnel appears healthy in the dashboard but no traffic passes through.\n\n**Steps to
  reproduce:**\n1. Run cloudflared tunnel with default config\n2. Simulate memory pressure (`stress --vm 4 --vm-bytes 1G`)\n3. Wait for OOM killer to free
  memory\n4. Observe tunnel status — shows connected but traffic times out\n\n**Expected behavior:** cloudflared should detect connection loss and reconnect
   automatically.\n\n**Workaround:** Manual service restart recovers the tunnel.\n\nThis is affecting three production nodes in our cluster.",

   just to understand what a \"config.yml\" even is. This is absolutely unacceptable for a company the size of Cloudflare.\n\nOther tunnel solutions have
  nice desktop apps. Why can't you just make a simple GUI wrapper? How hard can it be???\n\nI'm mad that I wasted my entire Saturday on this. Terrible UX.
